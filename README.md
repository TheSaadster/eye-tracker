# Eye Tracker with Blink-to-Click

This project uses your **webcam, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI** to control your mouse with your eyes. After a quick calibration step, the program maps your gaze direction to screen coordinates and lets you **click by blinking**.

## üöÄ Features

* Real-time **eye tracking** using MediaPipe Face Mesh.
* **Calibration step** for more accurate screen mapping.
* **Blink detection** (close your eyes for a short moment to click).
* **Smoothing filter** for less jittery cursor movement.
* Runs on a normal webcam ‚Äî no special hardware required.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
